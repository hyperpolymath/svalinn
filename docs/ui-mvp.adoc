= UI MVP Spec (Containers + Inspector)
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 2

This specification outlines a minimal UI that makes verified containers usable
for non-specialists.

== 1. Primary Views

=== 1.1 Containers List

* Columns: Name, Image, Status, Policy Verdict, Last Event
* Actions: Start, Stop, Remove, Inspect
* Badge: Policy verdict (green/amber/red)

=== 1.2 Inspector

Tabs:

* Overview: status, image digest, runtime profile
* Attestations: predicates, signer key IDs, log IDs
* Logs: tail with filter and copy
* Config: ports, env, volumes, network
* Policy: reason + `vordr explain` output

=== 1.3 Run Wizard

Fields:

* Image name
* Ports (repeatable)
* Env vars (repeatable)
* Volumes (repeatable)
* Policy profile (strict/balanced/dev)
* Remove on exit (toggle)

=== 1.4 Policy & Trust

* Policy summary (required predicates, log quorum)
* Trust store (signer IDs + log operators)
* "Why rejected?" help panel

== 2. UX Behaviors

* Show a default "safe" preset with minimal fields.
* Provide a one-click "copy docker run" equivalent.
* Use inline error callouts with fix suggestions.
* Offer a "developer mode" to relax policy for local tests.

== 3. Required Data

From the gateway:

* `/verify` report output (predicates, signers, logs)
* `/run` response (jobId, policyHash)
* `/status/:id` for state

From Vordr:

* `vordr ps --json`
* `vordr inspect --json <id>`
* `vordr logs <id>`

== 4. Empty States

* No containers: prompt to run an image with the wizard.
* No attestations: show what is missing and link to documentation.
